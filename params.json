RackDAV brings its own file backend, but other backends are\r\npossible by subclassing RackDAV::Resource.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nJust install the gem from RubyGems:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install rack_dav\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\nIf you just want to share a folder over WebDAV, you can just start a\r\nsimple server with:\r\n\r\n    $ rack_dav\r\n\r\nThis will start a WEBrick server on port 3000, which you can connect\r\nto without authentication.\r\n\r\n## Rack Handler\r\n\r\nUsing RackDAV inside a rack application is quite easy. A simple rackup\r\nscript looks like this:\r\n\r\n    require 'rubygems'\r\n    require 'rack_dav'\r\n    \r\n    use Rack::CommonLogger\r\n    \r\n    run RackDAV::Handler.new(:root => '/path/to/docs')\r\n\r\n[1]: http://github.com/chneukirchen/rack\r\n"}
